In this implementation we put the U(1)B symmetry

ok. runing step by step

1. Anomaly good
2. working without mixing
3. Computing neutrino masses at tree level.
4. Using SARAH-4.12.3
5. Using Sheno-4.0.3
6. Two neutrino masive
7. One new scalars (bi=Phi) the gets VEV
8. Notation for Calhep and micromegas_5.0.4. Working
9. One Scalar (bj=S) that does no have VEV (inert)
